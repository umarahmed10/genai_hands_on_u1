## Phase 4 – Build & Innovate: Legal Clause Risk Analyzer

**Domain:** Law

**Project Idea:** Legal Clause Risk Analyzer

Build a tool that takes a contract clause as input and highlights potential risks such as ambiguous liability, unfair termination conditions, or missing data protection language.

**System Components:**
- Extract key legal entities (parties, dates, obligations)
- Classify clauses into categories (confidentiality, termination, payment, IP, liability)
- Generate natural-language explanations of potential risks

This demonstrates how NLP models can support legal compliance and contract review workflows.
